## Introducing FACEIO NPM Package

* **TLDR;** [FACEIO](https://faceio.net) is a facial authentication framework that is to be implemented on websites or web applications via simple JavaScript snippet (just like Disqus or Google Tag) to easily authenticate users via **Face Recognition instead of the traditional login/password pair or OTP code**.
* FACEIO is a cross-browser, Cloud & On-Premise deployable, facial authentication framework, with a client-side JavaScript library (fio.js) that [integrates seamlessly](https://faceio.net/integration-guide) with any website or web application desiring to offer secure facial recognition experience to their users...
* Put it simply, FACEIO is the easiest way to add passwordless authentication to websites or web applications. Simply implement fio.js on your website, and you will be able to **instantly authenticate your existing users, and enroll new ones via Face Recognition** using their computer Webcam or smartphone frontal camera on their favorite browser.
* Once fio.js [implemented](https://faceio.net/integration-guide) on your website, you'll be able to instantly recognize your existing users, on-board new members securely with maximum convenience, and at real-time thanks to passwordless experience powered by face recognition.

# `fio.js` LIBRARY & WIDGET INTEGRATION

The FACEIO Widget is a simple and elegant interface to provide **secure facial authentication experience to your users** via simple calls to the `enroll()` & `authenticate()` methods. The Widget is powered by the `fio.js `JavaScript library, which is simple enough to [integrate](https://faceio.net/integration-guide#fiojs-integration) in a matter of minutes while being flexible enough to support highly customized setups. Once implemented on your website or web-based application, you'll be able to authenticate your existing users, enroll new ones securely, with maximum convenience on their favorite browser, and at real-time thanks to passwordless experience powered by face recognition.

`fio.js` works with regular webcams, and smartphones frontal camera on all modern browsers, **does not require biometric sensors**, and works seemingly with all websites and web applications regardless of the underlying front-end technology used (ie. React, Vue, jQuery, Vanilla Javascript, static HTML, etc.) or server-side language or framework (eg. PHP, Python, Node.js, Rust, Elixir, etc.).

Itâ€™s super quick to get FACEIO Up & Running with just few lines of code. Follow the walkthrough below to implement `fio.js` on your site.

> ## STEP 1 - IMPORT `fio.js` TO YOUR SITE

```js
import faceIO from '@faceio/fiojs'

const faceio = new faceIO('app-public-id') // Get the application Public ID at https://console.faceio.net.
```

ðŸ‘‰ You shouldn't run `fio.js` functions right after initiating it.

ðŸ’¡ Take a look to our **community contributed tutorials** [listed here](https://faceio.net/integration-guide#community-tutorials). They should help you implement `fio.js` on your website or web application using your favorite JavaScript framework whether it is React, Vue, Angular, Next or Vanilla JavaScript.

> ## STEP 2 - INVOKE THE WIDGET

```js
import faceIO from '@faceio/fiojs'

const faceio = new faceIO('app-public-id'); // Get the application Public ID at https://console.faceio.net.

function App() {
    return (
    <div className="App">
        <button onClick={enrollNewUser}>Enroll New User</button>
        <button onClick={authenticateUser}>Authenticate User</button>
    </div>
    );
}

async function enrollNewUser() {
    // call to faceio.enroll() here will automatically trigger the on-boarding process
}
async function authenticateUser(){
    // call to faceio.authenticate() here will automatically trigger the facial authentication process
}
function handleError(errCode){
     // Handle error here
}

export default App;
```

> ## `ENROLL()` - ENROLL NEW USER
â€Ž
> ### SYNTAX

```js
const userInfo = await faceio
.enroll({ parameters })
.catch(errCode => {
  /* handle the error */
})

console.log(userInfo)
```

> ### ALIAS
`enrol()`, `register()`, `record()`

> ### PARAMETERS
`enroll()` takes a **single, optional `parameters` object** with the properties to be configured. The table below lists all possible `properties` of the parameters object:

Example of useful payloads includes *Email Address, Name, ID, Token*, and so on. This payload will be **forwarded back to you** upon successful [future authentication](https://faceio.net/integration-guide#authenticate_return) of this particular user. Maximum payload size per user is set to 16KB.                                                                                                                                          |

| `termsTimeout`       | Number                | 10 Minutes    | **Total number of minutes to wait for the user to accept FACEIO/Host Application Terms of Service**. Passing this delay, the ongoing `enroll()` operation is aborted and the promise is rejected with the `fioErrCode.TERMS_NOT_ACCEPTED` [error code](https://faceio.net/integration-guide#error-codes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `idleTimeout`        | Number                | 27 Seconds    | **Total number of seconds to wait before giving up if no faces were detected during the enrollment process**. Passing this delay, the ongoing operation is aborted and the promise is rejected with the `fioErrCode.NO_FACES_DETECTED` [error code](https://faceio.net/integration-guide#error-codes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Passing this delay, the ongoing operation is aborted and the promise is rejected with the `fioErrCode.TIMEOUT` [error code](https://faceio.net/integration-guide#error-codes).                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If this value is missing or set to auto, then the interaction language will be deducted from the [Accept-Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) HTTP request header.

When the user create a new account on your Website and accept the terms), you can **set this parameter** to true. In which case, the Terms of Use consent screen is not displayed for the end user being enrolled. **It is your responsibility to explicitly ask for consent before enrolling a new user**. For additional information, please consult our Privacy Best Practices for applications. |

> ## `RESTARTSESSION()` - REQUEST NEW USER SESSION
â€Ž
> ### SYNTAX
â€Ž
```js
const boolean = await faceio.restartSession({})
```

> ### PARAMETERS
â€Ž
*None*

> ### RETURN VALUE

`true` if the request for a new session have been granted, and ready for another round of calls to [enroll()](https://faceio.net/integration-guide#enroll) or [authenticate()](https://faceio.net/integration-guide#authenticate) for the same user. false otherwise.
